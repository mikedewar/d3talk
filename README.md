A talk aimed to try and get data scientists over that first hump of d3's learing curve and into the beautiful vista beyond...

The code for the slide mechanics was written by Mike Bostock in d3! The data is from meetup.com's public API.

In order to actually run through talk, clone this repository and run this command from inside the cloned dir:

`python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000`

Then point your browser at http://localhost:8000
